To run the server to test the app 
Access the file use the CLI 
and execute 
	npm run devStart 

Then use HTML file called index.html


To run on a different machine 
open another CLI tab and execute 
	http-server . -p *port no.*

in our case the port is 6000
if the port yields an error 
replace the 6000 with 3000 in the 3 files
index.html , script.js, server.js
